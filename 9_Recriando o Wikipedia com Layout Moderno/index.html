            <h2>Tudo sobre Game of Thrones</h2>
            <p>Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss
                for HBO. It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, a series of fantasy novels by George R. R.
                Martin, the first of which is A Game of Thrones. The show premiered on HBO in the United States on April
                17, 2011, and concluded on May 19, 2019, with 73 episodes broadcast over eight seasons.

                Set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has a large ensemble cast and
                follows several story arcs throughout the course of the show. The first major arc concerns the Iron
                Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros through a web of political conflicts among the noble families
                either vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from whoever sits on it. The second major
                arc focuses on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, who has been exiled to Essos
                and is plotting to return and reclaim the throne. The third follows the Night's Watch, a military order
                defending the realm against threats from beyond the Seven Kingdoms' northern border.

                Game of Thrones attracted a record viewership on HBO and has a broad, active, and international fan
                base. Many critics and publications have named the show one of the greatest television series of all
                time. Critics have praised the series for its acting, complex characters, story, scope, and production
                values, although its frequent use of nudity and violence (including sexual violence) generated
                controversy. The final season received significant criticism for its reduced length and creative
                decisions, with many considering it a disappointing conclusion. The series received 59 Primetime Emmy
                Awards, the most by a drama series, including Outstanding Drama Series in 2015, 2016, 2018 and 2019. Its
                other awards and nominations include three Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation, a Peabody Award,
                and five nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama.
